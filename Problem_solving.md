First I downloaded the instructions, then I made a repository to View them in I broke everything down into markdown. I read the instructions over carefully. I then used Claude code to analyze the markdown and make a PRD. The plan is to use the PRD to make an app. I'll use clogged code as an assistant to help with planning and structure. 

I'm going to utilize clog code to analyze the markdown file that was just made and help me plan a method for a MVP and choose a tech stack to use. 

I made a PRD with claude code. I will then utilize the task management tool and task manager to have it simultaneously make the code.
