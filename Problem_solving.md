First I downloaded the instructions, then I made a repository to View them in I broke everything down into markdown. I read the instructions over carefully. I then used Claude code to analyze the markdown and make a PRD. The plan is to use the PRD to make an app. I'll use clogged code as an assistant to help with planning and structure. 

I'm going to utilize clog code to analyze the markdown file that was just made and help me plan a method for a MVP and choose a tech stack to use. 

I made a PRD with claude code. I will then utilize the task management tool and task manager to have it simultaneously make the code. I front-loaded my Claude MD file to have the set instructions so that I can reference where to go if it needs to reference, and my preferred coding standards and paradigms. 

I set up the Azure Foundry using the GPT-40 mini model and the Azure Vision Service on the regular Azure cloud system. 
The backend has been made, but it needs verification and validation, so phase one is complete, but No, validation has been done yet. 

Anthropic just rolled out a new feature. It's experimental. However, I want to see how well it can do. The time is 2.54. I am going to ask oh gosh I don't know if I trust this right I'm gonna ask it to finish the rest of the project based on the PRD I'm going to have it create a team of agents each with their own specialty and division and testing. 

Seven minutes later. It came up with a plan is now 3:05 I Asked it to look at the remaining phases use the new teams tool and Work it out now that the plan has finished. Let's see how long it takes.
